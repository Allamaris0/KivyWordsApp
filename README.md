# Baby Words
The application is created with frameworks Kivy and KivyMD. The purpose of the application is to teach reading using the Glenn Doman's method.

You can create sets of words and also add images.

I tested .apk on my phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro). <strong>The app is safe. It requires access to storage to add images. It doesn't require access to Internet. It doesn't gather any your data.</strong> However it should work if someone deny to give the permission but without adding images.

<strong>Possible issues</strong>
After adding an image, don't remove the image and don't change its location. It could crash the app. I will change it in the future.
